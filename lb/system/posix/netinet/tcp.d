/*

The <netinet/tcp.h> header shall define the following macro for use as a socket option at the IPPROTO_TCP level:

TCP_NODELAY
Avoid coalescing of small segments.

The macro shall be defined in the header. The implementation need not allow the value of the option to be set via setsockopt() or retrieved via getsockopt().
